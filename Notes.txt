About Exit codes in index.js

exit(0) - we exited and everything is OK.
exit(any number other than 0) - means we exited because something went wrong.


About Restart Policy in docker-compose

"no" - container is not going to Restart
always - container is going to restart as soon as it got stopped
on-failure - container will restart only when it got stopped because of some failure i.e, error code other than 0
unless-stopped - container will start automatically unless it has been stopped forcibly stopped form the command line by running "docker stop"

NOTE: if you are going to use the no-restart policy you specificly have to put in quotes like "no" or 'no', because a raw text no is considered as false in YAML world.
